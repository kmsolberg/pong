# Pong Game

This project is a basic pong game using SVGs.  It was designed as an introduction to using OOP, SVGs and Webpack.

## Personal Learnings
- I learned a lot about local scope on this project, especially with the OOP. It is very useful when you're bringing together multiple elements.
- There are often several solutions to everything, and deciding which is the best can depend on the amount of code, what else it may affect or be affected by.
- SVGs are useful for scaling but difficult to render if you want more than a basic shape.
- Continued to build technical and javascript foundation
- OOP can be complex to tackle at first, but is useful long-term expecially with larger projects, and is great for having multiple aspects being merged into one cohesive unit.
- EX.next fixed many of the things I found confusing about Javascript and it was nice to be able to use those new tools.
